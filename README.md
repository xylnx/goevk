# GOEVK Frontend

This is a simple react app providing a frontend for `GOEVK - Dein Veranstaltungskalender für Göttingen`. It was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project displays and filters data on events taking place in [Goettingen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6ttingen), a university town in Lower Saxony, Germany. The data is scraped and served by the [GOEVK api](https://github.com/xylnx/goevk-api).
